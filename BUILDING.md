# Building and Running

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) — optional, for issue and PR management

## Build all images

Run once, and again after any Dockerfile change:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Build a single image and its dependencies:

```bash
./build.sh base      # base image only
./build.sh crypto    # base + crypto
./build.sh systems   # base + systems
./build.sh research  # base + research
```

Add `--no-cache` to force a full rebuild (pulls updated apt packages):

```bash
./build.sh --no-cache
```

## Start a session

```bash
./start.sh <project_directory> [image]
```

`image` defaults to `base`. Valid options: `base`, `crypto`, `systems`, `research`.

```bash
./start.sh ~/projects/mylib crypto      # HSM / cryptography work
./start.sh ~/projects/myapp systems     # C++ / CMake projects
./start.sh ~/projects/paper research    # LaTeX documents
./start.sh ~/projects/webapp            # web / Python / TypeScript
```

## First-time network setup

The sandbox requires a Docker bridge network. Create it once:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge claude-net
```

## Authentication

Claude Code requires an Anthropic API key. On first use, authenticate on
the host and pass the key into containers via the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
environment variable. See `docs/claude_code_security_plan.md` §Phase 1
for the full authentication setup procedure.
